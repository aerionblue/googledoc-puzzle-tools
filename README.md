# googledoc-puzzle-tools
Scripts and functions for puzzle hunt (two words) puzzles.

If you're on my team, this extension is installed by default on our Google Workspace domain, but you have to manually enable it on each sheet where you want to use it. Just click `Extensions > Puzzle Tools > Enable for this sheet`.

# Features

## Custom Menu Items
*  *Square Cells* - Make all selected cells squares of some size. 20 is good for letters.
*  *Symmetrify Grid* - Make the selected cells have symmetry with regard to background color.
    Rotational (standard crossword) and bilateral are both supported.
*  *Formatting Shortcuts* - Apply some commonly-used formatting (and conditional formatting) to cells.
    * *Crossword grid* - Prepare a range of columns to hold a crossword grid.
       Most notably, sets the conditional formatting so that a cell whose
       value is "/" will become a black square.

## Added functions

These have all been removed and superseded by named functions, many imported from the community [Google Sheets Puzzle Tricks spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTVD0KtjbU6-wp1mvYU_abrjdCmnP9focRa1qp36rrY/edit).
